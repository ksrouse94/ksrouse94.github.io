Coding is an intensively creative process. You start with nothing and through a series of keywords and processes, you make something entirely new. 

I've always loved creating things, whether it was through arts and crafts as a child or arranging music during college. There's something so satisfying in knowing that I came up with an idea and saw it through from beginning to end. As a child, I always imagined spending my life creating things. From a young age, I knew that that's what I was meant to do. But after college, it became clear that until I found a way to turn creativity into a living, I was going to have to find a stable, full-time job.

Enter workers' compensation.

Workers' Comp is a steady field with only growth ahead of it. It was the sensible thing to turn to so that I could make a living and at least try to sustain myself. But after only a year, I could feel myself starting to deteriorate intellectually and creatively. To make it plain: I was stagnating. I was doing the same things day in and day out with no end in sight. Then, to make matters worse, the living I was making no longer covered my expenses. Student loan payments, groceries, medical bills... I couldn't afford any of it. It was at that point that I knew something had to give. I needed to find a way out.

So I came back to coding. I had dabbled in it while in college, but it wasn't something that I'd seen myself doing for the future at the time. I'd thought, then, that you had to have a certain type of mind in order to be good at coding, and I just didn't have it. But as time went on, I found myself coming back to coding again and again. I realized I was taking time out my day to complete coding projects, and that had to mean something. 

So now here I am giving this another try. I'm determined to see this through and to make a better life for myself as a result.
