<p>After working for a year in workers' compensation, I realized I needed a change in careers. I was stagnating and just searching for a way to be more creative in my everyday life. So I turned to coding. It was something I'd enjoyed doing back in college, though I didn't have the time I needed to dedicate to it. So here I am. Back at it. This time to finish what I started those years ago and to make a better life for myself.</p>
